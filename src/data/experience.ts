          At Klarna I took part in a project to implement the next generation of customer authentication to create a central location
          where users could sign in instead of the multiple current solutions.

          The work consisted of both managing requirements such as writing RFCs to discover potential solutions and actual implementation of the service. 
          There were a lot of challenges and learnings in having to communicate and collaborate with a large number of teams all relying on the authentication solution.

          On the technology side the solution was implemented as a containerised microservice and deployed on AWS.

    I got contracted as a senior software engineer at Telia to work within a project for 
    Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM).

    I like to work on all sides of our application so some days I work on our frontend applications built with React, 
    some days working on our identity provider built with node.js running in AWS Lambdas, some days configuring our 
    infrastructure with CloudFormation or Terraform, some days working on our CI/CD pipelines with GitHub actions and 
    some days working on our micro services built with Golang running in AWS Lambda.

    After getting up to speed and working in the team for a while I was the driving force for replacing the licensed 
    identity provider that was used with an open source alternative, which ended up giving us a lot more flexibility and 
    reducing cost in licensing. It was a great way to learn how the OIDC protocol works by implementing an OIDC Provider 
    from scratch.

    applications as well as web based admin applications.

    Since we were a small team it was important to be able to solve any issue you can encounter when providing a system
